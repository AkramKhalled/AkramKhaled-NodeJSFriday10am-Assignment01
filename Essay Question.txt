Q1. What is the difference between forEach and for...of? When would you use each?
A. 
forEach: An array method used to run a function on every element, 
mainly for side effects (like logging or updating something). 
You can’t use break/continue, and it’s not good with async/await because it won’t wait for promises.

for...of: A loop that works with any iterable (arrays, strings, sets, maps) 
and gives you more control. You can use break/continue/return, 
and it’s the better choice when you need early stopping or await inside the loop.

Use forEach for simple “do this for each item” tasks.
Use for...of when you need control flow or async logic.

Q2. What is hoisting and what is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)? Explain with examples.
A.
Hoisting is JavaScript moving declarations to the top of their scope before execution.

var is hoisted and initialized to undefined, so you can read it before its line (but it’s undefined).

Function declarations are fully hoisted, so you can call them before they appear.

TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) is the period where let/const are in scope but cannot be accessed 
until their declaration line runs—accessing them before that throws a ReferenceError.

console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 1;

console.log(y); // ReferenceError (TDZ)
let y = 2;

Q3. What are the main differences between == and ===?
== (loose equality) compares values after type coercion (it may convert one type to another), 
so results can be unexpected.
Example: 0 == "0" → true

=== (strict equality) compares value and type with no coercion, so it’s safer and preferred.
Example: 0 === "0" → false

Q4. Explain how try-catch works and why it is important in async operations.
A. 
try...catch lets you run code in try and handle errors in catch instead of crashing the program.
It’s important in async operations because await can throw (if a Promise rejects), 
and try...catch lets you safely handle that failure (log it, show a message, retry, etc.).

Q5. What’s the difference between type conversion and coercion? Provide examples of each.
A. 
Type conversion is an explicit change of a value’s type (you do it on purpose).
Examples :
Number("123");
String(10);
Boolean(0);

Type coercion is an implicit type change done automatically by JavaScript during an operation.
Example:
"5" + 1;
"5" - 1;
0 == "0";
